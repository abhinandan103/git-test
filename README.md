# CycleDehaze in PyTorch

Reimplementation of _**Cycle-Dehaze: Enhanced CycleGAN for Single Image Dehazing**_ - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05308.pdf

Cycle-Dehaze : end-to-end generative adversarial networks for single image dehazing, which does not require pairs of hazy and corresponding ground truth images for training, i.e. we train the network by feeding clean and hazy images in an unpaired manner.
